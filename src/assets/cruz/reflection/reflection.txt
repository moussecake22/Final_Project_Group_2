This project demonstrates the comprehensive application of modern DevOps and deployment methodologies by integrating a static web application with containerization and automated orchestration. Leveraging Docker, the application achieves portability, consistency, and scalability across diverse environments. The incorporation of Ansible streamlines the workflow by automating image creation, configuration management, and container deployment across both CentOS and Ubuntu virtual machines, reducing manual intervention and potential errors. Overall, the project illustrates how the combination of automation, containerization, and cross-platform deployment enhances operational efficiency, ensures system reliability, and supports rapid, consistent delivery of web applications in dynamic production environments.
