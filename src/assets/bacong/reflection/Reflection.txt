This final project helped me understand how all the topics we studied throughout the semester actually work together in a real deployment setup. At first, I only had a basic idea of how Docker, Ansible, and web development connected, but doing the tasks step-by-step made everything clearer. Building the folder structure, preparing the JSON content for each member, and seeing how the portfolio became dynamic made me appreciate how organization affects the whole project.

One of the biggest things I learned was how important automation is. Manually configuring servers is tiring and prone to errors, so using Ansible to install Docker, build the image, and deploy containers felt like a major improvement. I also realized the value of testing, because a small mistake in a file path or indentation could break the whole setup. Overall, this activity really boosted my confidence in handling DevOps-related tasks, and it gave me a good foundation for future projects involving automation and containerization.
